Some things we want to track:
- Owners of Nodes
  - People: Me, Parents, Friends
  - At least: Me
- Cost post
- Taking ownership or not of money from certain nodes
  - Default: take ownership
- Tag transactions
- Tag generating rules per
  - Node
  - Global
  - Generate set of tags from Transaction

Thinking about interface:
- Generate set of unique nodes
  - Heap: most frequent nodes to the top
- Then allow some user config per node
  - name (override)
  - owner
- User tag system

List of owners:
- List nodes per owner

Process:
Command line interface?
1. Load all csv's into set of transactions: remove duplicates
2.
