Some things we want to track:
- Owners of Nodes
  - People: Me, Parents, Friends
  - At least: Me
- Cost post
- Taking ownership or not of money from certain nodes
  - Default: take ownership
- Tag transactions
- Tag generating rules per
  - Node
  - Global
  - Generate set of tags from Transaction

Thinking about interface:
- Generate set of unique nodes
  - Heap: most frequent nodes to the top
- Then allow some user config per node
  - name (override)
  - owner
- User tag system

List of owners:
- List nodes per owner

Workflow:
1. Configuration Mode
  - Allow the user to configure systems and rules for analysis
  - (View:Nodes) Summary list of nodes in the system, allow user to select node(s) 
    to configure.
  - (View:Node) Detail view of a specific node, allow user to configure properties
    of this node: - Set owner, - Set tags, - Set name, - Seed values, - Etc.
  - (View:Owner/s) List owners (most cases probably just one: you), allow user to 
    assign properties: - Owned nodes, 
  - (View:Rules) Define rules on transactions.
  - (View:Transactions) Mainly debugging, immutable view of imported transactions.

Command line interface/tui?
1. Load all csv's into set of transactions: remove duplicates
  - Store versions of these parsed transactions? -> Perhaps later
    if we the cost of recomputing every time is too much.
  - Just load them into a HashSet? -> No, then you lose the order (within the day)
    - Does losing order matter? We can order at the granularity of days,
      which is fine enough?

Some things to track in state:
- Owners
- Owners -(owned)-> {Nodes}
- Nodes that have certain properties set:
